# hBQN
BQN QuasiQuotes

## Why

I was just watching [Functional vs Array Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UogkQ67d0nY) and thought it very useful being able to express intent in such a short succinct way.

[APL](https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/) or the newer [BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) seem perfect for a QuasiQuotes DSL.

I found
- an old mail thread about this [https://www.mail-archive.com/haskell-cafe@haskell.org/msg107983.html]
- Simon Peyton Jones made a wiki with a prototype implementation https://wiki.haskell.org/APL
