# hBQN
BQN QuasiQuotes

## Why

I was just watching [Functional vs Array Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UogkQ67d0nY) and thought it very useful being able to express intent in such a short succinct way.

[APL](https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/) or the newer [BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) seem perfect for a QuasiQuotes DSL.

## References
- Madeline Vergani has an APL interpreter written in haskell https://github.com/RubenVerg/tinyapl that has the base haskell data types and functions defined but not a parser for APL itself.
- an old mail thread about this [https://www.mail-archive.com/haskell-cafe@haskell.org/msg107983.html]
- Simon Peyton Jones made a wiki with a prototype implementation https://wiki.haskell.org/APL

## Questions that Need Answering

How does one reference external haskell variables?

Is it possible to use polymorphism to allow type checking? Or, is BQN to dynamically typed to allow for this?
